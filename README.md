# Udemy_Sales_Analysis
A sample of courses published on udemy.com was gathered from an article on Medium; the courses were grouped into four category. The dataset was cleaned, manipulated and explored for insight using standard pythonic programming. The cleaned dataset was exported as excel and subsequently loaded into Power BI Desktop to build an interactive dashboard.

# This project is based on the dataset for the Udemy Data Analytics Project published on Medium. A member of the data team at Udemy had worked on the project with excel and visualised with PowerBI but I will be using python and PowerBI.

The scope of the project covers only four course categories: Business Finance, Graphics Design, Musical Instruments and Web Development.

The aim is to explore the number of courses for each subject area, the number of subscribers, how well the courses were rated and how much revenue is being generated etc. For each subject category, we will also identify the key words for the most best rated and most sought after courses..

# We will find answers to the following questions and more:

Which subject area has the highest and lowest number of published courses?
Which subject area has the highest number of subscribers?
What levels of courses are free?
What words are common among the courses with high ratings and number of subscriptions?
How well were the courses rated by subscribers?
For each subject category, what year were most courses published?
Which suject area contributes the most to the companies revenue?

# Comments
The dataset is limited to only four subject areas while leaving out a ton of interesting areas including Data Science, Cyber Security, Cloud Computing, Digital Marketing.
The dataset is not updated to the current year, 2022. It would have been nice to see how digital learning grew in the Covid-19 era.
There are no demographic data on the subscribers and the duration of their learning of the chosen subject.
The rating of the courses didnt provide details of the comments made by the subscribers.
It was not expressely stated what the unit of the course duration was - whether hours or minutes.
It was not explained what the scale of the Rating was; does a rating of 0.0 mean there was no rating at all or the course received the least score.
There is no data on the content creators; it would have been great to know which tutors make the most subscribed and best rated contents.
